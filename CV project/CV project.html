                        <h3>Fundamental</h3> 
                        The work experience/job history on a resume is where past job descriptions and professional experiences 
                        give credibility to an application or interview. All the other information and sections on a resume, from 
                        hobbies to the personal statement , frame the list of relevant work experience over the last 10 - 15 years.
                        So, how do I describe my work experience on a resume?
    
                        This guide will show you everything you need to know about including work experience on a resume, 
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Associat</h3>
                        The five-word rule. Think about five words that would be sum up your career. How would you 
                        describe your experience? Those five words should then come across incredibly strongly in the 
                        work experience on a resume. A hiring manager is not going to remember the sentences that you 
                        rite, but if they stop reading with those five words (or more) in their minds, your resume will 
                        have done its job.

                        The skills section of your resume shows employers you have the abilities required to succeed in 
                        the role. Often, employers pay special attention to this section to determine if you should move 
                        on to the next step of the hiring process.
